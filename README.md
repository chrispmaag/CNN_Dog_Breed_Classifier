- Classified dog breeds and identified human faces using Keras
- Implemented VGG16 and ResNet50 transfer learning to improve model performance
- Given an image of a dog, algorithm identified an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed
- If given an image of a human, the code identifies the most similar dog breed
